## Bugs

Please report any bugs you find [here][issues]. Try to be as descriptive as possible and make sure to check if the bug has already been reported _before_ reporting it yourself. 
Please only report one bug per issue - if you have encountered multiple issues, report multiple bugs as separate issues.

## Feature Requests

New features should also be reported as [issues]. Please try to describe the feature you are suggesting in as much detail as possible and explain _why_ it would be useful. 
As explained above, please first check the feature hasn't already been requested and make sure your issue only covers one feature. If you have multiple ideas, open separate issues.
